# Buidling Springboot Applications - From Newbie to Badass.

> "_Convention over configuration_"


## About

:: The goal of this repository is to help java developers who want to start building web applications via springboot get started with less hassle.

:: The project codes are organised as Basic Folder - Intermediate Folder - Advanced Folder. Hence readers of the code can understand what concepts are required at what level

:: The codes are self documented with appropriate comments for an intuitive flow of concepts. 

`NB`: This is only for educational purpose and not for instructional purpose. Some of the concepts used here are liekly to get outdated overtime. I would try my best to keep refactoring the code and add new stuffs as time goes on.
